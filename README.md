# Skola24 to Google Calendar
A simple application for syncing a Skola24 schedule to a Google Calendar.

Currently features:
- Smart sync; only syncing the events that have been updated since the last run.
- Event color; mapping Skola24 colors to Google Calendar (approximately, since Google Calendar only supports 10 different colors)
- Multiple calendars; syncing multiple calendars at once, and specifying unique names for each one.

## Why?
My school uses Skola24 to provide schedules, but Google Calendar for things like tests or homework. 
I like having everything in the same place, and thus decided to write this simple script so I don't have to use Skola24.
